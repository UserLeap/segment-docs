The Engage Source Debugger enables you to inspect and monitor events that Engage sends downstream

Because Engage generates a unique Source for every Destination connected to a Space, the Debugger gives you insight into how Engage sends events before they reach their Destination.

The Debugger provides you with the payload information you need to troubleshoot potential formatting issues and ensure Engage sends events as your Destinations expect.

## Working with the Debugger

Navigate to the Debugger tab on the Profiles Settings page of the space you want to debug. Select the Source you want to inspect in the Debugger.

The Debugger presents a stream of incoming events. The event inspector displays three tabs for each event:

* **Pretty view** shows the actual API call Segment sends to your Destination.
* **Raw view** shows the full JSON object Segment sends to your Destination from the calls you sent, including timestamps, properties, traits, and ids.
* **Violations** displays any violations triggered by the event.

Similar to the Connections Debugger, you can search through events using information contained within the event's payload.
